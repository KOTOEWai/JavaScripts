# JavaScript Lexical Structure

JavaScript's **lexical structure** describes the basic building blocks of the language — the rules for writing code, forming tokens, naming variables, writing comments, and more. This document explains each part clearly.

---

## 1. What is Lexical Structure?

Lexical structure defines **how JavaScript source code is read and broken into tokens**. It includes:

* Character set
* Case sensitivity
* Whitespace
* Line terminators
* Comments
* Literals
* Identifiers & keywords
* Operators & punctuators

---

## 2. Character Set

JavaScript uses the **Unicode** character set.

* This means it supports characters from almost all languages.
* Variable names can include Unicode letters — even emojis (not recommended in production).

```js
let မြန်မာ = "Hello";
let 🚀 = 10;
```

---

## 3. Case Sensitivity

JavaScript is **case-sensitive**.

```js
let name = "A";
let Name = "B"; // different variable
```

Keywords are also case-sensitive.

---

## 4. Whitespace

Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and newlines.

* JavaScript generally **ignores whitespace**, except in specific cases.

Example:

```js
let x = 10;
let  y    =    20;
```

Both are valid.

---

## 5. Line Terminators

Line terminators are characters such as:

* `\n` (newline)
* `\r` (carriage return)

They can affect automatic semicolon insertion (ASI), so be careful.

Example (dangerous):

```js
return
  5; // returns undefined due to ASI
```

---

## 6. Comments

### Single-line comment

```js
// This is a comment
```

### Multi-line comment

```js
/*
  This is a multi-line comment
*/
```

**Note:** Comments do not nest.

---

## 7. Identifiers

Identifiers are names for:

* variables
* functions
* classes

Rules:

* Must start with: letter, `_`, `$`
* After first char: digits are allowed.

Valid:

```js
let _value;
let $item;
let user123;
```

Invalid:

```js
let 1user; // cannot start with digit
```

---

## 8. Keywords

These words have special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers.
Examples:

```
break, case, class, const, continue, debugger, default,
delete, do, else, export, extends, finally, for, function,
if, import, in, instanceof, let, new, return, super,
switch, this, throw, try, typeof, var, void, while, with, yield
```

---

## 9. Literals

Literals are fixed values appearing directly in code.

### Number literals

```js
let a = 10;
let b = 3.14;
let hex = 0xFF;
let binary = 0b1010;
```

### String literals

```js
let s1 = "hello";
let s2 = 'world';
let s3 = `template literal`;
```

### Boolean literals

```js
true, false
```

### Null & Undefined

```js
null;
undefined;
```

---

## 10. Operators & Punctuators

These include:

* `+ - * / %`
* `= += -= *=`
* `== === != !==`
* `{ } [ ] ( )`
* `, ; . ? :`

JavaScript treats these as tokens during lexical scanning.

---

## 11. Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)

JavaScript automatically inserts semicolons in some cases.
This can cause unexpected behavior.

Bad:

```js
let x = 5
let y = 10
(x + y).toString() // treated as function call
```

Recommended:

* Always use semicolons
  or
* Follow JS formatting rules carefully.

---

## 12. Escape Sequences

Used inside strings:

* `\n` → newline
* `\t` → tab
* `\"` → double-quote
* `\\` → backslash

Example:

```js
let text = "Hello\nWorld";
```

---

## 13. Unicode Escapes

Identifiers may include Unicode escapes:

```js
let \u006Eame = "John"; // same as "name"
```

String Unicode:

```js
"\u{1F600}"; // 😀
```

---

## Summary

JavaScript lexical structure defines **how source code is read**, including:

* Unicode support
* Case sensitivity
* Whitespace handling
* Comments
* Identifiers & keywords
* Literals
* Operators & punctuation
* ASI behavior

Understanding these rules helps you write cleaner and more predictable JavaScript.
